        most pages are completely responsive except nav bar, just minor adjustments
        color palettes good!

----add headers that get inserted into each view with mustache(nav bar) -- actually only needed for dashboard and gabs pages


----make reused queries and validations external functions that get called on

----rework some of the file structure (user route can all be one, includes dashboard, look up examples)
